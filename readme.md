# WordPress testplugin AcronymReplacer #

Simple plugin to test the `Compact_KeyValue_List` class. This plugin is working, but should not be used in a production environment!

For detailed information*, see the [readme_compact_keyvalue_list.md](https://github.com/RalfAlbert/WordPress-AcronymReplacer/blob/master/classes/readme_compakt_keyvalue_list.md) in the classes folder.
